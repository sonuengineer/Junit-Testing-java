Unit Testing with JUnit
Part 1: Writing Unit Tests
Open the Drive package and explore the classes and what they do.

Open the DriversManagerTest class and implement unit test for the following scenarios:

Verify a Passenger is added correctly
Verify a Driver is added correctly
Implement the following unit test in the DriversManagerTest class:

   @Test
   public void startTripTest(){

   }

   @Test
   public void endTripTest(){

   }
Part 2: Test Driven Development
Implement the following unit test so it fails:
   @Test
   public void nextAvailableDriverTest(){

   }
Part 3: Writing Tests for Edge Cases
Think of 2 edge cases that have not been tested. Write a unit test for each case.
Challenge Yourself
As you can see this algorithm is not very fair. It does not consider distance so the drivers will always get paid the same fee. Modify the code so it considers distance too.
